#Trail-Maps-Over-Google-Earth
============================
Paper trail maps placed on top of Google Earth (via Image Overlay), then saved as KMZ format to be uploaded to GPS unit.

These maps were overlayed to the best of my ability and are to be used as a rough guide. Due to either the accuracy of the original files or my abilities, these maps are not 100% accurate. Use at your own risk.
